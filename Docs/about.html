                Hi! My name is Manuel Amoros. I am a curious young man that has embarked on a challenging 
                journey in the field of Computer Science. As i am not very talented in this field of 
                knowledge, i make up my deficiencies with as much work as i can. I am a work in progress 
                and always in constant construction. Ubiquitous Assimilation, as some like to call it. 
                I read a lot and practice as much sport as i can, including Rugby. If you'd like to know 
                more about me i encourage you to head over to the <a href="#">Contact</a>page to reach out.
            </p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Music:</strong> Its pretty much all i do in my free time. Driving up
                    someplace peaceful and play my guitar or harmonica is what keeps me going sometimes. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sports:</strong> After an extensive history in many sports, i have started
                    to play Rugby at university to keep myself active. I have grown very fond of this 
                    gruesome sport even though injuries are pretty much a certainty.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>
                My mission is to become the greatest version of myself. To rise above my setbacks and my demons
                and prove to my parents that they have done a good job. I plan on becoming someone reliable and loyal
                to God, my family, and myself. 
            </p>
