            <h1>Description of the Course</h1>
            <p>
                "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to provide a global vision of Computer Engineering in both
                academic and professional points of view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which
                this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), the future professional careers and the
                role of a computer engineer in today's society.
                The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the second helps
                develop practical skills.
                The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content.
                <p>
                1) Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical perspective: past, present and future of Computer
                Engineering. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological
                and ethical foundations.
                </p>
                <p>
                2) Information and Data: Information representation. Organization of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                3) Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in
                computer systems and applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an introduction to web
                development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on contents related
                to the course.
                Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the development
                basic soft-skills for an engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills, both oral and
                written, of technical information, favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational
                project of the University.
                </p>
            </p>

            <h2>GOALS</h2>
            <p>
                The specific objectives of this course are designed to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the
                field of Computer Engineering:
                <p>
                - Grasp the essential objectives of Computer Engineering, its ultimate goals, and the value it brings to society,
                while contemplating the role you aspire to play as an engineer in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                - Gain knowledge of the fundamental principles upon which technological progress should be based, with an
                initial historical perspective on technological development.
                </p>
                <p>
                - Recognize the importance of the human element in professional practice and cultivate a commitment to
                service and contributing to the common good.
                </p>
                <p>
                - Achieve a global vision of the field, understand its various areas of knowledge, and identify different career
                paths and professional profiles to begin questioning your own vocational calling.
                </p>
                <p>
                - Acquire knowledge about current paradigms, trends in computing, data management, and an introduction to
                web development. 
                </p>
            </p>
            <h2>Practical Assignments</h2>
            <p>
                There have been 2 practical assignments with different activities within them. 

                Practical Work 1: 
                This practical work project aims to explore various aspects related to the course. Gaining in-depth understanding of a specific advancement in computing and technology is essential.
                My topic was generative AI in video creation.

                Practical Work 2:
                You are looking right at it. The goal of this project is to create a website that documents and showcases everything you have learned in this subject. We design and develop a personal website that highlights your proficiency in HTML and CSS.
