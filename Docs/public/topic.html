            <h2>History of NASCAR</h2>
            <p>
                NASCAR was founded by Bill France Sr. in Daytona Beach, Florida. The first sanctioned race took place on February 15, 1948,
                and since then, NASCAR has become synonymous with speed, power, and adrenaline. Over the years, the sport has evolved,
                with the introduction of the NASCAR Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Truck Series, among other racing events.
